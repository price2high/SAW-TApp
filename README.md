A "Build a Sentiment Analysis Web Tool" is a project where you create a web application that allows users to input text—like reviews, comments, or tweets—and get feedback on whether the sentiment behind the text is positive, negative, or neutral.
This program is good for people that struggle with empathy and have a hard time processing other people's emotions.

Product reviews (positive/negative feedback)

- Social media monitoring
- Customer support
- Brand reputation analysis

## 🧱 What Does the Web Tool Do?
- User Interface (Frontend):
  - Text input box for users to paste their text
  - Button to submit the text for analysis
  - Displays results: e.g., “Positive 😊”, “Negative 😡”, or “Neutral 😐”
- Backend/Model:
  - A trained machine learning or deep learning model processes the input and returns the sentiment
  - Uses NLP libraries (like NLTK, TextBlob, spaCy, or Hugging Face Transformers)
- Hosting/Deployment:
  - Can be hosted on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Vercel
  - Frontend: React, HTML/CSS, or Flask Templates
  - Backend: Python (Flask or Django), Node.js, etc.
